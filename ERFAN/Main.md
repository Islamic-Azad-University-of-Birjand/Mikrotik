## What is MikroTik?

**MikroTik** is the name of a company that produces products related to computer networking. **MikroTik** is based on Linux and, when installed on dedicated hardware like RouterBOARD or x86-based computers, turns the hardware into a network router with the same features. The company initially focused on writing software for 32-bit computer hardware but gradually shifted towards producing networking products.

## Applications and Advantages of MikroTik Routers:

You might be wondering where **MikroTik** is used! Let me explain:

- **Routing**

Routing with **MikroTik** is easier and faster.

- **Firewall**

MikroTik also includes a firewall feature, allowing you to restrict incoming and outgoing network ports, which enhances network security.

- **DHCP Server**

With **DHCP servers**, you can assign a unique IP address to each system. **MikroTik routers** support this capability.

- **Wireless**

Various wireless technologies are supported by MikroTik, and I recommend exploring this feature.

- **Load Balancing**

A **load balancer** helps maintain network stability, allowing you to use two internet service networks simultaneously. By connecting a second internet service to the network, it prevents internet outages and interruptions.

- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

The **MikroTik operating system** uses various VPN methods to create secure connections.

- **MikroTik Hot Spot Gateway**

This feature allows for public network connections without the need for software installation or network configuration. With hot spot gateways, you can set up a login and authentication page for each separate network, providing better management of users at the network level.

- **MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching)**

MPLS is a technique that replaces traditional IP addressing methods for fast routing and shaping traffic flows in the network.

## What are the Disadvantages of MikroTik?

In general, MikroTik routers do not have significant issues, but it is important to note that:

- MikroTik devices are not upgradable.
